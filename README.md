Drive For Show, Putt For Dough
# PGA TOUR PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
This project analyzes the relationship between driving and putting performance and their impact on success metrics on the PGA Tour. The goal is to determine which aspects of a player's game best predict overall success, including scoring, earnings, and points.
# 1. Data & Method
Dataset(s):
The dataset includes PGA Tour player statistics such as:
- Driving Distance
- Fairway Hit Percentage
- One-Putt Percentage
- Average Score
- Money Earned
- FedExCup Points

Source
[Insert dataset source here or describe how to access/download the data, e.g. Kaggle, PGA Tour official stats, CSV files included in the repo]

Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression
- Correlation analysis and interpretation of R² values
# 2. Visualitzation and Final Findings
Scatter plots showing relationships between:
- Driving Distance vs. Fairway Hit %
- Driving Distance vs. Average Score
- Proximity to Hole vs. One-Putt %

- Bar charts and regression plots showing key predictors of success

- Final findings indicate that:
[Insert summary of main findings here: e.g., "Putting stats have the highest correlation with average score."]
[Insert R² values or other performance metrics]
All visualizations are included in the /visualizations folder and embedded in the final report.
